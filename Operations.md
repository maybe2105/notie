source object

```
[
    {
        "p": [
            "content"
        ],
        "od": "??/ is it wo",
        "oi": "??/ is it wor"
    },
    {
        "p": [
            "updatedBy"
        ],
        "od": "luan",
        "oi": "luan"
    },
    {
        "p": [
            "updatedAt"
        ],
        "od": "2025-04-02T18:47:22.641Z",
        "oi": "2025-04-02T18:47:22.749Z"
    }
]

```

and non-source object ( from other people )
will be sent one by one, instead of array of 3 like above

```
[
    {
        "p": [
            "content"
        ],
        "od": "??/ is it working ? tes",
        "oi": "??/ is it working ? test"
    }
]
[
    {
        "p": [
            "updatedBy"
        ],
        "od": "pro",
        "oi": "pro"
    }
]
```
